### `SUBSCRIPTION-SAFE · OPEN SOURCE · SKELETON`

# Subscription-Safe Starter

**The minimal skeleton for building an autonomous AI agent on a flat Claude Max subscription instead of burning pay-per-token API credits.**

## What this is

A bare-bones starter showing the folder structure + config stubs for building an autonomous AI agent that runs via `claude -p` subprocess + Telegram bridge + Obsidian-style markdown vault.

**Zero variable cost.** Your Claude Max subscription covers the LLM calls. Flat monthly. No API metering, no runaway bills.

## What's in the box

- ✅ Obsidian vault layout (`Areas/`, `Projects/`, `_System/`, `MEMORY/`, etc.)
- ✅ `.env.example` with safe defaults (Sonnet, conservative rate limits)
- ✅ pai-mobile system prompt template with vault path placeholders
- ✅ Setup script stub showing the shape

## What's NOT in the box

This repo is the skeleton. The full implementation lives in [the Kit](https://jaredcunningham.gumroad.com/l/subscription-safe-ai-kit):

- ❌ Working agent persona files (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `STATE.md`, `MEMORY.md`)
- ❌ Complete pai-mobile system prompt, vault-routed
- ❌ Working installer script
- ❌ Cost-safety checklists
- ❌ OpenClaw migration playbook
